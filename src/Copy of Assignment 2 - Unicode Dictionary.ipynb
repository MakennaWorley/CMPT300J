The key is a single English word, and the value is a list of all Unicode characters whose names contain this keyword.\n","\n","2. The key is not case sensitive. \n","\n","3. Suppose the dictionary is `d` and the key is `k`, by running `d[k]`: \n","\n","    ```\n","    if d already has key k:\n","        return the value d[k]\n","    else:\n","        if there is no Unicode character whose name contains k\n","            raise a KeyError or print an error message\n","        else:\n","            build a list of all Unicode characters whose names contain keyword k, as the value d[k]\n","    ```\n","\n","4.

You could build the code based on your solution to this question in activity 3: `Build your own dictionary class that the key words are not case sensitive.`, which inherits `collections.UserDict` and implements three following methods:\n","\n","    - miss\n","    - contain\n","    - setitem\n","\n","2. You need to add one more dunder method repr/str to support the customized print function. \n","\n","3. In order to find all Unicode characters with a keyword, you can use a brute force method like this one using the package `unicodedata`:\n","\n","    ```\n","    loop over all unicode points from 0 to 0x110000:\n","        get the character at this code point\n","        if the name of this character contains keyword:\n","            append this character to a list\n","\n","    ```\n","4. If the if clause in step 3 returns `ValueError: no such name`, you need to ignore this error and continue the loop. You could use try-exception to handle this error.
